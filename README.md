# Project Description
This program leverages AI to compare wedding costs, addressing the societal issue of high wedding expenses. The goal is to minimize these costs by helping users find the most affordable options. In the future, as fixed pricing policies are implemented, the program will be further developed to calculate the optimal wedding costs.
